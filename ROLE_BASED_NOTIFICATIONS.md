# Role-Based Notification System

## âœ… **Features Implemented**

### **1. Role-Based Permission System**
- **Admin Users**: Automatically receive all notifications (isAdmin: true or admin roles)
- **Employee Users**: Receive notifications based on their assigned permissions
- **Permission-Based Filtering**: Only users with specific module permissions receive notifications

### **2. Notification Types Added**

#### **Proposal Notifications**
- `proposal_created`: When a new proposal is created
- `proposal_updated`: When a proposal is updated with change details

#### **Project Notifications**
- `project_created`: When a new project is created
- `project_updated`: When a project is updated with change details

#### **Employee Notifications**
- `employee_created`: When a new employee is added
- `employee_updated`: When an employee is updated with change details

### **3. Enhanced Notification Service**

#### **New Functions Added**
```javascript
// Get users with specific permissions
getUsersWithPermission(module, action = 'view')

// Create role-based notifications
createProposalNotification({ type, title, body, data, proposalId, triggeredBy })
createProjectNotification({ type, title, body, data, projectId, triggeredBy })
createEmployeeNotification({ type, title, body, data, employeeId, triggeredBy })
```

#### **Permission Detection Logic**
```javascript
// Admin users (all permissions)
const adminUsers = await User.find({
  $or: [
    { isAdmin: true },
    { role: { $in: ['admin', 'hotel admin', 'super admin'] } }
  ]
});

// Employees with specific permissions
const employeesWithPermission = await UserEmployee.find({
  'permissions': {
    $elemMatch: {
      'page': { $regex: new RegExp(module, 'i') },
      [`actions.${action}`]: true
    }
  }
});
```

### **4. Detailed Change Tracking**

#### **Proposal Changes**
- Customer name, project amount, services, status, comment
- Shows previous and new values

#### **Project Changes**
- Customer name, project amount, services, project status, comment
- Shows previous and new values

#### **Employee Changes**
- First name, last name, email, mobile number, department, status, role
- Shows previous and new values

### **5. Enhanced Mobile Display**

#### **New Color Coding**
```javascript
// Purple for creation notifications
'proposal_created', 'project_created', 'employee_created'

// Yellow for update notifications  
'proposal_updated', 'project_updated', 'employee_updated'
```

#### **Dynamic Labels**
- "Created by:" for creation notifications
- "Updated by:" for update notifications
- "Added by:" for employee additions

## ðŸ“Š **Notification Flow**

### **1. Proposal Creation**
```
User creates proposal â†’ Check permissions â†’ Send to users with 'proposals' view permission â†’ Exclude creator
```

### **2. Proposal Update**
```
User updates proposal â†’ Compare with original â†’ Detect changes â†’ Send to users with 'proposals' view permission â†’ Exclude creator
```

### **3. Project Creation**
```
User creates project â†’ Check permissions â†’ Send to users with 'projects' view permission â†’ Exclude creator
```

### **4. Project Update**
```
User updates project â†’ Compare with original â†’ Detect changes â†’ Send to users with 'projects' view permission â†’ Exclude creator
```

### **5. Employee Creation**
```
User adds employee â†’ Check permissions â†’ Send to users with 'employees' view permission â†’ Exclude creator
```

### **6. Employee Update**
```
User updates employee â†’ Compare with original â†’ Detect changes â†’ Send to users with 'employees' view permission â†’ Exclude creator
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Permission-Based Targeting**

### **Admin Users**
- âœ… Receive ALL notifications automatically
- âœ… No permission checks needed
- âœ… Full system access

### **Employee Users**
- âœ… Receive notifications only for modules they have access to
- âœ… Based on their assigned role permissions
- âœ… Filtered by specific actions (view, create, edit, delete)

### **Permission Structure**
```javascript
permissions: [
  {
    page: "Proposals",
    url: "/dashboard/proposals", 
    actions: {
      view: true,
      add: true,
      edit: false,
      delete: false
    }
  }
]
```

## ðŸ§ª **Test Scenarios**

### **Test 1: Proposal Creation**
1. Create a new proposal
2. **Expected**: Only users with 'proposals' view permission receive notification
3. **Expected**: Creator is excluded from notifications
4. **Expected**: Shows detailed proposal information

### **Test 2: Proposal Update**
1. Update proposal details
2. **Expected**: Shows what was changed (customer name, amount, etc.)
3. **Expected**: Shows previous and new values
4. **Expected**: Only users with 'proposals' view permission notified

### **Test 3: Project Creation**
1. Create a new project
2. **Expected**: Only users with 'projects' view permission receive notification
3. **Expected**: Shows project details and creator information

### **Test 4: Employee Management**
1. Add/update employee
2. **Expected**: Only users with 'employees' view permission receive notification
3. **Expected**: Shows employee details and changes made

### **Test 5: Role-Based Filtering**
1. Create user with limited permissions
2. **Expected**: User only receives notifications for modules they have access to
3. **Expected**: Admin users receive all notifications

## âœ… **Success Criteria**

- âœ… **Role-based targeting** - Notifications sent only to users with appropriate permissions
- âœ… **Permission filtering** - Based on user roles and assigned permissions
- âœ… **Creator exclusion** - User who performed action doesn't receive notification
- âœ… **Detailed change tracking** - Shows what was changed with previous/new values
- âœ… **Enhanced mobile display** - New colors and labels for different notification types
- âœ… **Admin/Employee distinction** - Different handling for admin vs employee users
- âœ… **Error handling** - Notification failures don't break main operations
- âœ… **Scalable architecture** - Easy to add new notification types

## ðŸš€ **Ready for Testing**

The role-based notification system is now **fully implemented and ready for testing**:

1. **Restart your server** to apply all changes
2. **Create/update proposals** - should send notifications to users with proposal permissions
3. **Create/update projects** - should send notifications to users with project permissions  
4. **Add/update employees** - should send notifications to users with employee permissions
5. **Check mobile app** - should display new notification types with proper colors and labels
6. **Verify role filtering** - users should only receive notifications for modules they have access to

**Expected Result**: Intelligent, permission-based notifications that keep users informed about relevant changes while respecting their access levels! ðŸŽ‰
