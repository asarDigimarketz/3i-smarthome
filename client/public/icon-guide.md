  - Simplified version of your 3i logo for small displays

### Action Button Icons

## Icon Creation Tips

1. **Use your brand colors**: Red gradient (#8B1538) and white
2. **Keep it simple**: Icons should be recognizable at small sizes
3. **Maintain consistency**: All icons should follow your brand style
4. **Test at different sizes**: Ensure readability at all required dimensions
